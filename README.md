## How Did We Get Here?
Welcome to Stadium Rcket, a floating arena built by aliens to host soccer games for the cars they kidnap. Our main character Charlie finds himself here along with a few of his fellow kidnapped cars to play a game of soccer.

The only catch is that if they lose, they and Earth will be damed to a fate of death and destruction. *No pressure, really*
