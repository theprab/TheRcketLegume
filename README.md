# TheRcketLegume

## How Did We Get Here?
Welcome to Stadium Rcket, a floating arena built by aliens to host soccer games for the cars they kidnap. Our main character Charlie finds himself here along with a few of his fellow kidnapped cars to play a game of soccer.

The only catch is that if they lose, they and Earth will be damed to a fate of death and destruction. *No pressure, really*

## What is Rcket Legume?
Rcket Legume is a whirlwind of ideas thrown into one that became a 3D car soccer game and a passion project of mine that I kept adding to as inspiration struck.
